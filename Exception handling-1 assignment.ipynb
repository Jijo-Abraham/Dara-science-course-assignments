    "#### In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When a Python script encounters an exceptional condition (such as division by zero, accessing an index out of range, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist), it raises an exception. If the exception is not handled by the program, it typically terminates the program and displays an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors usually happen before the program is executed because they prevent the interpreter from parsing the code correctly. Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, mismatched indentation, and using reserved keywords incorrectly."
