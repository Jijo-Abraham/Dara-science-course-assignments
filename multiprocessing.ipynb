    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to execute multiple processes concurrently, by utilizing multiple CPU cores. The multiprocessing module in Python supports the creation, management, and synchronization of processes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Parallel Execution: Allows for the concurrent execution of tasks, which can significantly speed up computations.\n",
    "CPU-Bound Tasks: Ideal for tasks that require a lot of CPU resources, as it can leverage multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, which helps prevent issues like data corruption that can occur in multithreading due to shared memory.\n",
    "Improved Performance: Especially for CPU-bound operations where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python would otherwise be a bottleneck in a multithreaded context."

    "GIL: Multithreading in Python is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. Multiprocessing does not have this limitation as each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "Memory: Threads share the same memory space, while processes have separate memory spaces.\n",
    "Overhead: Creating a new process has more overhead than creating a new thread due to the need to allocate separate memory space.\n",
    "Use Case: Multithreading is generally more efficient for I/O-bound tasks, whereas multiprocessing is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks."
